### Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 🎉

Hi there, I'm **Mead Solomon**! 👋

## About Me 🚀
I'm an attorney turned software engineer and it has been quite a journey. The beauty of problem-solving in code appeals to me as much as it did in law. When I'm not neck-deep in code, you'd find me trying out new recipes or communing with nature. My interests in food and the outdoors keeps me happy and motivated. 

I love developing unique, efficient solutions for various programming challenges, as well as collaborating on projects. 

## Connect with me 🖇️
I'm always open to connect, collaborate, or just chat about anything under the sun (or outside it). 
Reach me at 📫 **meadsolomon@gmail.com**

Have a great day!
