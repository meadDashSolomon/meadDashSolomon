### Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 🎉

Hi there, I'm **Mead Dashiell Solomon**! 👋

## About Me 🚀
I'm a lawyer turned coder and it has been quite a journey! The beauty of design, problem-solving, and language drew me to tech. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'd find me trying out new recipes or lost in the woods. My interests in food and the outdoors provide me with a break from screens and a chance to come up with new ideas. 

## Connect with me 🖇️
I'm always open to connect, collaborate, or just chat. 
Reach me at 📫 **meadsolomon@gmail.com**

Have a great day!
