## About Me 🚀
I'm a lawyer turned software engineer and it has been quite a journey! The beauty of design, problem-solving, and language drew me to tech. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'd find me trying out new recipes or lost in the woods. My interests in food and the outdoors provide me with a break from screens and a chance to come up with new ideas. 

## Lessons from the Law ⚖️
While law and software engineering seem worlds apart, there's a common structural core: understanding and achieving client objectives. In software engineering, this begins with a requirements specification, where clients outline their vision for a product. Similarly, in law, clients present the facts and issues at hand. The ensuing process in both fields involves applying specific tools to these initial inputs to realize client goals. In software engineering, these tools are programming languages and methodologies, while in law, they're legal rules and precedents.
